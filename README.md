# Prosperity
Hi, I'm Fernando Pelegrini and I live in São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. I'm taking the fullstack programmer course at Senai Technical School. I intend to start my project called Prosperity whose objective is to put face to face the needs of a group or community on the one hand and the people with the skills to solve them on the other. All people who can help, like UX designer, data analist, front and backend developper and so on, are welcome.
Potential users of the application are volunteer groups, communities with specific needs looking for people with skills that can solve them, public institutions that want to use information about the needs of communities to design or implement public policies.
The application is to be used predominantly via mobile devices and the internet. I'm using html5, css3, javascript and Java.
